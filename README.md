# Financial Crime ML Repository

## 📌 About Me
Hi! I'm Simone Ladisa, a Senior Data Scientist with extensive experience in machine learning, AI, and data-driven decision-making. I am particularly interested in applying AI techniques to **financial crime prevention, fraud detection, and regulatory compliance**.

This repository is dedicated to showcasing my work in **financial crime analytics**, featuring various machine learning models and methodologies to detect fraudulent activities and mitigate financial risks.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
The goal of this repository is to **develop, experiment, and showcase AI-driven models** that can:
- Detect **fraudulent transactions** using machine learning and anomaly detection techniques.
- Build **risk scoring models** for AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance.
- Enhance real-time **identity verification and fraud prevention**.
- Explore advanced techniques like **graph-based fraud detection, network analysis, and deep learning**.

## 🚀 Projects in This Repository

### 1️⃣ Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions
- **Description**: Machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions in a synthetic dataset.
- **Techniques Used**: 
  - Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.
  - Anomaly Detection: Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor.
  - Data Balancing: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
- **Repository Path**: [`fraud-detection-transactions/`](./fraud-detection-transactions/)
- **Status**: ✅ Completed (Version 1.0)

## 📅 Future Projects (Planned)
- **AML Risk Scoring Model** (Customer risk assessment using machine learning).
- **Real-time Fraud Detection System** (Streaming anomaly detection for financial transactions).
- **Graph-based Fraud Detection** (Using graph analytics for fraud pattern identification).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming**: Python
