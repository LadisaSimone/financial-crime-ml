# Financial Crime ML Repository

## 📌 About Me
Hi! I'm Simone Ladisa, a Senior Data Scientist with extensive experience in machine learning, AI, and data-driven decision-making. I am particularly interested in applying AI techniques to **financial crime prevention, fraud detection, and regulatory compliance**.

This repository is dedicated to showcasing my work in **financial crime analytics**, featuring various machine learning models and methodologies to detect fraudulent activities and mitigate financial risks.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
The goal of this repository is to **develop, experiment, and showcase AI-driven models** that can:
- Detect **fraudulent transactions** using machine learning and anomaly detection techniques.
- Build **risk scoring models** for AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance.
- Enhance real-time **identity verification and fraud prevention**.
- Explore advanced techniques like **graph-based fraud detection, network analysis, and deep learning**.
